# PoseNetify: Real-Time Human Pose Detection Using MediaPipe

## Overview
PoseNetify is a Python-based project that utilizes the **MediaPipe Pose** library to detect and analyze human body poses in real-time. The application is designed to track and display key points of the human body, making it suitable for applications such as fitness tracking, sports analysis, and gesture recognition.

## Features
- Real-time pose detection using MediaPipe's Pose solution.
- Visualization of body landmarks.
- Simple and lightweight implementation.
- Customizable for various use cases like fitness, gaming, and augmented reality.

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure the required libraries are installed.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python mediapipe_pose_tutorial.py
    ```
4. Use a webcam or video feed to detect and display poses.

## Output
The program will display a real-time video feed with key body landmarks and connections visualized.

## Applications
- Fitness tracking and posture analysis.
- Sports performance evaluation.
- Gesture-based controls for interactive applications.
- Research in biomechanics and human-computer interaction.
